An advanced AI-driven search engine designed to connect fashion suppliers and buyers through intelligent search and conversational interaction. This system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Hybrid Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find and rank fashion products based on user queries, overcoming challenges related to keyword variations, image mismatches, and customization needs.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Fashion suppliers often use diverse and SEO-optimized keywords that do not align with buyers' search intent. Additionally, images may not always convey the specific product features a buyer seeks. This creates a communication gap and makes it difficult for buyers to find exactly what they need. Our goal was to build an AI-powered search engine that enables seamless product discovery and enhances supplier-buyer interactions.

## 💡 Solution

We've developed an AI-powered conversational search AI agent  that:

- Allows users to converse with the search engine to refine queries and find the most relevant products.
- Bridges the communication gap between suppliers and buyers by understanding natural language queries and product descriptions.
- Supports multimodal search, integrating text, image, and vector-based search for comprehensive product discovery.
- Enables efficient supplier onboarding, helping them list their products with optimized searchability.
